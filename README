Sebastian Lague's platformer collision code, including slope handling, is probably my favorite bit of Unity code ever, so of course it was the first thing I tried to port over to ECS.
My first attempt at a port was eventually discarded when I moved from working on a small practice project to a full-on game project--I decided to stick with mostly MonoBehaviour on that project, since it's familiar to me, so I used a MonoBehaviour implementation--and improved it. When I realized an ECS port was desired by someone else, I threw together another port integrating the code cleanup(?) I did, as well as a little fix from Sebastian's YouTube comments, over the course of a couple hours. This is that version.

DISCLAIMER: I have never actually used this port--I just knocked it together over a couple of hours ofter I realized Matheusfx wanted it. Consequently, my tests consist exclusively of "can it be made to run without throwing errors;" I have not tried to introduce movement code to see if I made any mistakes. If you find any mistakes or errors, I will gladly fix them.

OTHER DISCLAIMER: I don't have almost any of the other parts of the Sebastian Lague Platformer. I could probably make an attempt to port the Moving Platforms code, but as I recall, that one gave me a bit of execution-order trouble...and as for movement code, I cast out most of that and replaced it with my own, and I never even watched the camera tutorials. (Probably should do that at some point, eh? Just to learn what he considers to be important in a camera system....) So if you want any of those parts ported, you may want to make that happen yourself.
